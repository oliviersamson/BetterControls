# BetterControls

This is a mod made to achieve a smoother experience while interacting with the game. 
The players's ping and hotbar access can now bound to any key supported by the default Unity input system!
This also comes with a new control to quickly switch between your last hotbar selection and your current one (Q by default).
Chest browsing was also made easier with the addition of the possibility of shift-clicking to transfer a stack from the inventory to the chest, cauldron or furnace! 
It is also now possible to transfer only half of a stack instantly with Shift+RightClick.

This mod is dependant on Terrain's SettingsApi mod. 
If you're like me and are a bit annoyed at how this new settings menu feel like, get my BetterSettingsApi mod for a feel closer to the original game.

# BetterControls

This is a mod made to achieve a smoother experience while interacting with the game.

This mod is dependant on Terrain's [SettingsApi](https://muck.thunderstore.io/package/Terrain/SettingsApi/ "Thunderstore") mod. 

If you're like me and are a bit annoyed at how his new settings menu feel like, get my [BetterSettingsApi](https://muck.thunderstore.io/package/MrBoxxy/BetterSettingsApi/ "Thunderstore") mod for a feel closer to the original game.
